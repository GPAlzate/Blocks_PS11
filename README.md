# Blocks_PS11

We have our code set up as an Eclipse project, but Blocks.java is the only file you should need (inside of PS11 and then inside src), and it's for running the whole algorithm. Within it is an inner class called Block.

To compile and run our code: you can simply download Blocks.java, then on command line, when you are inside the directory where you have the file, compile using javac Blocks.java. Then to run, use command
java Blocks <infile.txt> <outfile.txt>.
